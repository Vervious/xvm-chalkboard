Motivation: understand which chalkboards in Stata are the best to chalk
Inspired by: Anish Athalye's experiment (writeup [on his blog][http://www.anishathalye.com/2015/02/20/clickbait-in-the-physical-world/], code [on github][https://github.com/anishathalye/makecoffeefor.me/tree/master])

We're going to need to setup a mysql database. Make sure 
`mysql://root@localhost/gauged_chalkboard` exists and is accessible.

Also create a config.json file, based on the example.
