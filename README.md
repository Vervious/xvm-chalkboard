Motivation: understand which chalkboards in Stata are the best to chalk

Inspired by: 

Anish Athalye's experiment 
* (writeup [on his blog](http://www.anishathalye.com/2015/02/20/clickbait-in-the-physical-world/), 
code [on github](https://github.com/anishathalye/makecoffeefor.me/tree/master))

We're going to need to setup a mysql database. Make sure a
`mysql://username:password@localhost/database_name` exists and is accessible,
by specifying it in the config file.

Also create a config.json file, based on the example.
